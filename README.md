How does it work?
-----------------

Simply enter your Chinese (Mandarin) text above and analyze  
Get a list of words distributed by HSK level  
Common punctuation marks like 。，“” 《》· ？help split the text into sections but everything else is ignored

### Please Note!

There is no inference of meaning with regards to context. For example, the HSK 6 word  
爱不释手 will return the HSK 6 word - 爱不释手 as well as two HSK 1 words - 爱，不
